This hands-on workshop will prepare you to participate in the [Global WiDS datathon](https://www.widsconference.org/datathon.html). At the **WiDS Tucson Datathon** you will learn how to register to a Kaggle competition, prepare a solution for the competition with the Python programming language, and submit a Kaggle solution. Join us to participate in a **Titanic themed, Machine Learning datathon** aimed helping you to participate individually in the Global WiDS Datathon!

In this year's **Global WiDS Datathon**, participants will use data science to improve longer-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change.

Women in Data Science (WiDS) Tucson is an independent event organized by the University of Arizona to coincide with the Global WiDS Conference held at Stanford University and an estimated 200+ locations worldwide annually.

The Global WiDS Conference aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and to support women in the field. This one-day technical conference provides an opportunity to hear about the latest data science related research and applications in a number of domains, and connect with others in the field.

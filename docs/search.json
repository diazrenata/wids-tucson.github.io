    "text": "This Tucson WIDS meeting aims to further build the community around women in Data Science. The meeting provides a forum for women to share technical information about their projects with each other, and community members; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and new collaborations.\nWomen in the data science community are invited to present talks and posters on their projects. Anyone who is interested in attending the meeting is welcome and encouraged to do so.\nThere is no registration fee, but participants need to register by April 20th, 2023 at 12pm MST to allow for planning logistics. This meeting is virtual and will be hosted on Zoom. Participants are encouraged to move between Zoom meetings to maximize their own experience."

    "section": "",
    "text": "WiDS Tucson Meetings are an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the WIDS Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\nConsequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.\nSexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness.\nThe following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.\nHarassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.\nDiscrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person’s competence or suitability.\nRetaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment."

Her research program analyzes whether the enrollment management practices of public universities undermine access for underserved student populations, with a particular focus on recruiting and marketing. Using “data science” methodologies and FOIA requests as data collection strategies, her current work explores how university recruiting and marketing efforts spatially discriminate against high schools and communities with predominantly low-income students and Students of Color. Salazar’s research has been published in The American Educational Research Journal, The Journal of Higher Education, and Research in Higher Education. She is also co-principal investigator of the Enrollment Management, Recruiting, and Access research project, which has been featured by The New York Times, NPR, CNN, Inside Higher Ed, The Chronicle of Higher Education, Forbes, and U.S. News & World Report.

The CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance (eg: for the collective benefit, with the authority to control, carrying responsibility and ethics) are people and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing Indigenous innovation and self-determination. These principles complement the existing FAIR principles encouraging open and other data movements to consider both people and purpose in their advocacy and pursuits. These principles, when implemented into data practices, ensure Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing are present at all stages of the data life cycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Lydia Jennings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral AssociateUniversity of Arizona\n\n\n @1NativeSoilNerd\n\n\n\n\n Linkedin\n\n\n\n\n Website\n\n\n\n\nLydia grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico (Tewa lands) and is Huichol (Wixáritari) and Pascua Yaqui (Yoeme).

For example, in one of my group’s recordings, a speaker pronounced “gonna hafta” with just two syllables (sort of ” got.tuh”), and in another, a different speaker pronounced “do you have time” as two syllables with no trace of the word “have” at all. Another speaker pronounced “Friday night” as one syllable, something like “freh…” stretched out in time. And yet these fast, “sloppy” pronunciations sound fine if you hear them in context, and are not hard to understand if you’re hearing your native language. What’s amazing is that this is actually how we communicate information.  I also work with the Mutsun community of California, a Native American community from near San Juan Bautista CA, to try to help them learn their heritage language (Mutsun) and teach it in their community.

The event was introduced by WiDS Ambassador Bonnie LaFleur, followed by a keynote address from Calline Sanchez, VP, IBM Worldwide Systems Lab Services. Concurrent talks were given on Cancer Biology, Textual Data, Life Experiences in Suicide Individuals, Education Access Equity, and Data Policy followed. Panel discussions on Data Analytics in HealthCare, and on Entrepreneurship were each lively and informative, followed by DataBlitz three-minute lightning talks. The afternoon featured inspiring parallel Keynote talks from Marie Wesselhoft, Tech Launch Arizona Venture Development and President of MSDx; Deborah Hughes Hallett, Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and Professor at UArizona Mathematics; More concurrent talks followed, covering Ecosystem Science, Astrobiology, Educational & Psychological Measurement, Cultivating Productivity for Discovery, Indigenous Data Sovereignty, and Viewing fMRI Results. An animated panel discussion on Data Ethics & Bias generated thought-provoking questions and comments, followed by a poster session. The day concluded with a virtual Happy Hour, allowing participants more opportunities to network and brainstorm towards WiDS Tucson 2021.\nThe WiDS Tucson community expresses their gratitude to Susan Miller for her tireless energy to the advancement of women in data science, including bringing the WiDS conference to Tucson. The conference day was Susan’s last day before her retirement. We wish her well, and are hopeful that she will grace us with her assistance and presence next year!"

    "text": "WiDS Tucson Meetings are an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the WIDS Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.\nConsequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.\nSexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness.\nThe following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.\nHarassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.\nDiscrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person’s competence or suitability.\nRetaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment."

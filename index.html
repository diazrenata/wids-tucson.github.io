		<p>
			This Tucson WIDS meeting aims to further build the community around women in Data Science. The meeting provides a forum for women to share technical information about their projects with each other, iand community members; to explore innovative topics emerging in the software and data infrastructure communities; to discuss and learn about best practices across projects; and to stimulate new ideas of achieving software and data sustainability and new collaborations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			 Women in the data science community are invited to present talks and posters on their projects. Anyone who is interested in attending the meeting is welcome and encouraged to do so. There is no registration fee, but participants need to register by the deadline to allow for planning logistics.
		</p>
		<p>
			This meeting is virtual, and participants are encouraged to move from Zoom meeting to Zoom meeting to maximize their own experience.

									<p>Image registration is an inherently ill-posed problem that lacks a unique mapping between voxels of the two images being registered. As such, we must confine the registration to only physically meaningful transforms by regularizing it via an appropriate penalty term which can be calculated numerically or analytically. The numerical approach, however, is computationally expensive depending on the image size, and therefore analytical methods are preferable. Using cubic B-splines as the basis for registration, we develop a generalized mathematical framework that accommodates five distinct types of regularizers: diffusion, curvature, linear elastic, third-order, and total displacement. We validate our approach by testing the accuracy achieved by each of the regularizers against their numerical counterpart. We also provide benchmarking results showing that the analytic solutions run significantly faster --- up to two orders of magnitude --- than central-differencing based numerical solutions.<br /><br />As a case study, we show how to use deformable registration to improve the accuracy of the Multi-atlas based segmentation (MABS). The effect of various regularizers on MABS accuracy is compared using the Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics.</p>

									<p>Expanding opportunities for data-driven research and increasing requirements for data management in sponsored research have resulted in a growing need for retention of both long-term archival data sets that are infrequently accessed, as well as 'active archives' of data that are accessed periodically to revisit, revise, and share experimental results. For this project, the University of South Dakota acquired, deployed, and maintains the South Dakota Data Store (SDDS), a network-accessible, sharable, multi-campus storage resource integrated with existing campus cyberinfrastructure. SDDS supports twelve STEM projects across eight departments at four institutions in South Dakota, including 30 faculty, 43 postdocs, and 303 students. SDDS provides South Dakota researchers with a centralized, efficient, high-performance platform for both archival of and shared access to large quantities of electronic data.</p>

		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
		<p>
			The 2020 WIDS Meeting is an interactive environment for listening and considering new ideas from a diverse group, with respect for all participants without regard to gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or any other aspect of how we identify ourselves. It is the policy of the WIDS Meeting that all participants will enjoy an environment free from all forms of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Definition of Sexual Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person may be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.<br /><br />
				Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Other Harassment:</dt>
			<dd>
				Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to the following: epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Discrimination:</dt>
			<dd>
				Discrimination refers to bias or prejudice resulting in denial of opportunity, or unfair treatment regarding selection, promotion, or transfer. Discrimination is practiced commonly on the grounds of age, disability, ethnicity, origin, political belief, race, religion, sex, etc. factors which are irrelevant to a person's competence or suitability.
			</dd>
			<dt>Definition of Retaliation:</dt>
			<dd>
				Retaliation refers to taking some action to negatively impact another based on them reporting an act of discrimination or harassment.
			</dd>
			<dt>Reporting an Incident:</dt>
			<dd>
				Violations of this code of conduct policy should be reported immediately to the Organizing Committee Members (email: CSSI-PI-Meeting2020 at googlegroups dot com). All complaints will be treated seriously and be investigated promptly. Confidentiality will be honored to the extent permitted as long as the rights of others are not compromised.  Sanctions may range from verbal warning, to ejection from the 2018 NSF CSSI PI Meeting, to the notification of appropriate authorities. Retaliation for complaints of inappropriate conduct will not be tolerated.
